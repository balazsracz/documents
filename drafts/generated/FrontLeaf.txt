                                       Layout Command and Control – LCC

   This set of Standards and Technical Notes documents forms the basis and infrastructure for an extensible
   and flexible layout control bus system for Model Railroads. It is designed for both the novice and
   experienced modeler, and both small personal and large modular group layout.

   It was developed in public by the OpenLCB Development Team with the input from many people but
   especially the members of the OpenLCB egroup on Yahoogroups. It is the accumulation of years of work,
   following the NMRA Board mandated Goals and Mandate, and the self-determined Goals and Measures
   documents.

   These documents have been open to review for more than six months. The comments and errors were
   collected, considered and appied to the documents.

   In some cases, additional material was added to the documents. The largest of these additions was
   requested by three manufacturers to allow them to provide one connection on their LCC command stations,
   by adding support for a low-current DCC signal to be optionally carried on the two unassigned wires in
   the CAN Physical cable. The has been done in conjunction with the pre-existing NMRA S-9.1.2 DCC Power
   Station Interface standard.

   The OpenLCB Development Team includes: Stuart Baker USA, Balazs Racz Switzerland, Alex Shepherd New
   Zealand, David Harris Canada, Brian Barnst USA, Dick Bronson USA, Ken Cameron USA, Don Goodman-Wilson
   USA, Tim Hatch USA, Bob Jacobsen USA, Jim Kueneman USA, and others who have contributed their knowledge
   and inspiration.

   Special thanks to Stephen Priest, NMRA Board Liaison, and the members of the OpenLCB egroup, especially
   Robert Middleton, for their discussion, suggestions and review of the documents.
