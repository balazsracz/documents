                                                     Simple NodeTrain Information Protocol

                                                   Mar 10, 2014                        Preliminary          

                                                1 Introduction

   There is a need for something for tinytrain nodes, that uses a single message instead of datagrams and
   configuration. This allows getting getting the information with a bare minimum of support at the
   requested node end, so long as the requesting node can be sure to handle it.

   See the larger description in the ACDI TN, which should be copied here too. But note that SNII they can
   exist independently of whether ACDI is present in the node or not.

   The Simple NodeTrain Information Reply message(s) carry a stream of bytes:

     * The byte 1 to indicate the version of the following content

     * A null-terminated string for manufacturerthe road name name(i.e. “Rio Grande Southern”) of no more
       than 41 bytes including terminating null is recommended, but not required that this string be 32
       characters or less based on a single line display of a modern smart phone.

     * A null-terminated string for the node model nametrain class (i.e. “K-27”) of no more than 41 bytes
       including terminating null. is recommended, but not required that this string be 32 characters or
       less based on a single line display of a modern smart phone.

     * A null-terminated string for the node hardware versionroad number (i.e. “455”) of no more than 21
       bytes including terminating null. is recommended, but not required that this string be 32 characters
       or less based on a single line display of a modern smart phone.

     * A null-terminated string for node software versionthe train name (i.e “San Juan Express”) of no more
       than 21 bytes including terminating null. is recommended, but not required that this string be 32
       characters or less based on a single line display of a modern smart phone.

     * * The byte 1 to indicate the version of the following content

     * A null-terminated string for user-provided node name of no more than 63 bytes including terminating
       null.

     * A null-terminated string for user-provided node description of no more than 64 bytes including
       terminating null.A null-terminated string for the manufactures name (i.e “Blackstone”) is
       recommended, but not required that this string be 32 characters or less based on a single line
       display of a modern smart phone.

     * A null-terminated string for the owners name (i.e “John Smith”) is recommended, but not required
       that this string be 32 characters or less based on a single line display of a modern smart phone.

   Note that the total length, including version numbers and nulls, must be less than [253] bytes. This is
   based on the length of SNIP. There is discussion as to if this limit is needed. The argument is due to
   buffer management in a bridge between a fast and slow physical layer (Ethernet to CAN for instance). The
   bridge must buffer the entire Ethernet message then split it into CAN 8 byte messages. Having a fixed
   max length allows fixed buffers in the software/firmware development.

   The data returned by STIP must equivalent that is returned in the corresponding elements in the TDI
   Protocol.

   Note that the total length, including version numbers and nulls, must be less than 253 bytes.

2.5 Interactions

   When a node gets a SimpleSimple NodeTrain Information Request, if possible it shall reply with one or
   more Simple NodeTrain Information Reply messages containing the node'strain information. If it's not
   able to process the information, it shall send an Optional Interaction Rejected with an appropriate
   error code.

   It's recommended that the rejection message have the temporary-error bit set, so that the node sending
   the original request will retry it.

                                                3 Draft notes

   Handling a second request while sending the first: If they can't be queued for later (immediate)
   processing, the node can reply with OptionalInteractionRejected message that indicates the issue is
   temporary, and that the request should be retried if the information is still desired.

   (Setting of the first/last bits to make it a message; “because this version of the specification
   predates the use of first/last bits”, nodes initiating a transfer must be able to handle a series of
   reply messages)

   Do nodes sending the response need to be able to resend it in response to a TerminateDueToError? This
   might be needed is e.g. a gateway gets congested while merging frames.

   The information returned is intended to be considered static: A node may request it and never have to
   request it again, because it won't change. But the user might change the user-provided node name. How
   will other nodes know to do a SNTIIP request? They don't. Configuration tools could force themselves to
   reacquire the data, but there's no global notification of the change. (Allowing the node to only change
   on reset would fix that, because we could have SNPIIP users re-request the info when they see the
   reset.)
