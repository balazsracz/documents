                                                           OpenLCB Event Identifiers

                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This specification describes the format and allocation of OpenLCB event identifiers (event IDs). It is
   not specific to any wire protocol.

                                    2 References and Context (Informative)

   This specification is in the context of the following OpenLCB-CAN Standards … Specification, which
   specifies …:

   For more information on format and presentation, see:

     * The Message Network Standard, which defines the basic messages and how they interact. Higher-level
       protocols are based on this message network, but are defined elsewhere.

     * OpenLCB Common Information Technical NoteThe Event Transport Standard, which defines the protocol
       for transporting events.

     * The Unique Identifiers Standard witch defines the format and allocation of unique 48-bit
       identifiers.

                                                   3 Format

   An OpenLCB event identifier (node ID) shall be eight bytes of eight bits each. Except as specifically
   noted within this document, the upper 6-bytes are represented by a uniquely assigned Node ID.

   The order of bytes in an OpenLCB event ID shall be considered significant. The most-significant byte
   shall be transmitted first during communication operations. The most-significant byte shall be written
   first (left-most in Western format) in any human-readable representation.

   OpenLCB event IDs shall include one or more 1 bits.
