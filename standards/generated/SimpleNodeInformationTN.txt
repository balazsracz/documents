                                                    Simple Node Information Protocol(title)

                                                    Aug 4, 2012                        Preliminary          

                                                1 Introduction

   There is a need for something for tiny nodes, that uses a single message instead of datagrams and
   configuration. This allows getting getting the information with a bare minimum of support at the
   requested node end, so long as the requesting node can be sure to handle it.

   See the larger description in the ACDI TN, which should be copied here too. But note that SNII they can
   exist independently of whether ACDI is present in the node or not.

       Simple Node Information Reply         Y         0x3530    0x1Edd,dsss 53      Content, see below     

   The Simple Node Information Reply message(s) carry a stream of bytes:

     * The byte 1 to indicate the version of the following content

     * A null-terminated string for manufacturer name of no more than 41 bytes including terminating null.

     * A null-terminated string for node model name of no more than 41 bytes including terminating null.

     * A null-terminated string for node hardware version of no more than 21 bytes including terminating
       null.

     * A null-terminated string for node software version of no more than 21 bytes including terminating
       null.

     * The byte 1 to indicate the version of the following content

     * A null-terminated string for user-provided node name of no more than 63 bytes including terminating
       null.

     * A null-terminated string for user-provided node description of no more than 64 bytes including
       terminating null.

   Note that the total length, including version numbers and nulls, must be less than 253 bytes.

2.5 Interactions

   When a node gets a Simple Node Information Request, if possible it shall reply with one or more Simple
   Node Information Reply messages containing the node's information. If it's not able to process the
   information, it shall send an Optional Interaction Rejected with an appropriate error code.

   It's recommended that the rejection message have the temporary-error bit set, so that the node sending
   the original request will retry it.

                                                3 Draft notes

   Handling a second request while sending the first: If they can't be queued for later (immediate)
   processing, the node can reply with OptionalInteractionRejected message that indicates the issue is
   temporary, and that the request should be retried if the information is still desired.

   (Setting of the first/last bits to make it a message; “because this version of the specification
   predates the use of first/last bits”, nodes initiating a transfer must be able to handle a series of
   reply messages)

   Do nodes sending the response need to be able to resend it in response to a TerminateDueToError? This
   might be needed is e.g. a gateway gets congested while merging frames.
