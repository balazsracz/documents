                                                   Jun 15, 2012                        Preliminary          

                                                1 Introduction

   There is a need for something for tiny nodes, that uses a single message instead of datagrams and
   configuration. This allows getting getting the information with a bare minimum of support at the
   requested node end, so long as the requesting node can be sure to handle it.

   See the larger description in the ACDI TN, which should be copied here too. But note that SNII they can
   exist independently, which needs to be handled too.

   Handling a second request while sending the first. Directed, so CAN priority doesn't really help. Just
   reject (which kind) and have upstream resend the request, if you can't hold onto the request until it
   happens again.
