                                                            Firmware Upgrade(title)

                                                   Dec 29, 2015                    PreliminaryProposal      

                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This Standard defines a method for using OpenLCB protocols for upgrading the firmware of an OpenLCB
   node.Minimal introductory material, only the stuff that's absolutely needed to understand the Standard.
   This Standard is agnostic to the physical layer.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   This method is expected to be implemented in common Configuration Tool (CT) software packages. Any
   hardware device that is able to follow the interactions defined here and thereby receive a firmware
   upgrade through Any limitations to the area of use of the Standard.this method will be able to be
   updated using commonly available CT software. This reduces the burden of the manufacturers in that they
   don't need to develop and provide tools and user interface for firmware upgrade capability, as well as
   increases user satisfaction, because the user does not have to acquire and learn to use a new tool for
   each hardware manufacturer, but can use a tool she is already familiar with to update all conforming
   hardware nodes.

   This Standard does not define new protocols, but identifies a specific subset of the OpenLCB protocol
   stack that is necessary for the firmware upgrade to function, and defines the exact sequence of
   operations that are expected to happen during a firmware upgrade.

   The intended use of this subset is to allow manufacturers to supply their hardware with dual firmware,
   consisting of a “firmware upgrade” component with the minimum required support for firmware update, as
   well as a replaceable “production” firmware for full node operation.

                                             5 States (Normative)

   Vivamus tristique porta ornare. Vivamus feugiat dolor id lectus aliquet luctus. A powered-on hardware
   node may be in one of the following two states:

     * Firmware Upgrade state. In this state the node supports a writable Memory Space under the number of
       the Firmware Space to receive the firmware upgrade data, as defined in the firmware upgrade
       interaction. The hardware is not expected to perform any of its regular operations. The OpenLCB node
       shall still be standards compliant.

     * Operating state. In this state the node performs its desired function. The node in Operating state
       must not export a writable Memory Space under the number of the Firmware Space.

                                          6 Interactions (Normative)

6.1 Definitions

   There are two nodes involved in the firmware upgrade process:

   The Configuration Tool (CT) is the node with a user interface that is in possession of the new
   manufacturer-supplied firmware data file.

   The Target Node is the node whose firmware is being updated.

6.2 State transitions

   A node may not transition between Firmware Upgrade state and Operating state without returning to
   Uninitialized state, as defined by the OpenLCB Message Network standard.

   At power-up a hardware node shall start up in Operating state by default, unless one of the following
   conditions hold:

     * Regular operation is impossible due to the lack of a working firmware. In this case the Target Node
       may, but is not required to, emit a Producer-Consumer Event Report (PCER) message with the
       Well-Known Event ID “Firmware Corrupted” after reaching Initialized state.

     * The user has requested firmware upgrade mode using a hardware switch, if one is available. In this
       case, the Target Node may, but is not required to, emit a PCER message with the Well-Known Event ID
       “Firmware Upgrade Requested by Hardware Switch” after reaching Initialized state.

   To request a Target Node to transition from Firmware Upgrade state to Operating state, the Configuration
   Tool shall send a Memory Configuration protocol “Unfreeze” command for the memory space designated as
   Firmware Space. The Target Node shall acknowledge the completion of the state transition by sending a
   Node Initialization Complete message.

   To request a Target Node to transition to Firmware Upgrade state (from either Firmware Upgrade or
   Operating state), a Configuration Tool shall send a Memory Configuration protocol “Freeze” command for
   the memory space designated as Firmware space. The node shall acknowledge the completion of the state
   transition by sending a Node Initialization Complete message.

6.3 State identification

   A Target Node that supports the Firmware Upgrade Standard shall set the following bit(s) in the Protocol
   Support Reply message depending on its state:

    State                             Protocol bit (Normative)            Bit value (Informative)           

    Operating state                   Firmware Upgrade Protocol           0x00 00 20                        

    Firmware Upgrade state            Firmware Upgrade Active             0x00 00 10                        

6.4 Vivamus tristique porta ornare. Vivamus feugiat dolor id lectus aliquet luctus. Data Transfer

  6.4.1 Streaming transfer

   If the Target Node, while in Firmware Upgrade state, sets the “Stream Protocol” bit in the Protocol
   Support Reply packet, then the Configuration Tool shall transfer the manufacturer-supplied firmware data
   by performing a Memory Configuration protocol Stream Write to the memory space of Firmware Space, with a
   starting offset of zero (0). The stream data bytes are the unmodified, uninterpreted, exact sequence of
   the manufacturer-supplied firmware upgrade file.

   The Target Node being upgraded may, but is not required to, throttle the incoming data on the stream by
   means allowed by the Stream protocol.

   After transferring all the bytes in the manufacturer-supplied firmware data file, the CT shall wait
   until it would be allowed to send more data according to the Stream protocol. Then the CT shall close
   the stream as defined in the Stream protocol. Afterwards the CT may, but is not required to, initiate a
   transition to Operating state.

  6.4.2 Datagram transfer

   If the Target Node, while in Firmware Upgrade state, doe not set the “Stream Protocol” bit in the
   Protocol Support Reply packet, the Configuration Tool shall transfer the manufacturer-supplied firmware
   data by performing a sequence of Memory Configuration protocol Write commands, starting at offset 0,
   with exactly 64 bytes of payload in each datagram except the last, and the datagrams' offsets increasing
   by 64 bytes after each. The concatenated payloads of the Write messages sent shall be are the
   unmodified, uninterpreted, exact sequence of the manufacturer-supplied firmware upgrade file.

   The Target Node being upgraded may, but is not required to, throttle the incoming data on the stream by
   means allowed by the Datagram protocol and Memory Configuration Protocol.

   After transferring all the bytes in the manufacturer-supplied firmware data file, the CT shall wait
   until the last datagram is responded to as the Memory Configuration Protocol requires. Afterwards the CT
   may, but is not required to, initiate a transition to Operating state.

  6.4.3 Aborting and Completing the transfer

   If the node being upgraded encounters an error, it may abort the data transfer by aborting the stream
   with an error code when using the Stream protocol, or, respectively, returning a Datagram Reject with an
   error code or a Write Response Failed Memory Configuration datagram. If the transfer is aborted, the
   node is required to stay in Firmware Upgrade state. If the CT re-tries the transfer, it shall do so from
   offset zero again. If the Target Node aborted the transfer, it is not required to be able to return to
   Operating state until the transfer is re-tried and successfully completed; however, it is required to be
   able to boot after a power cycle and return to Firmware Upgrade state, able to accept a new firmware
   upgrade attempt.

6.5 Full sequence of firmware upgrade

   For a more detailed description of the messages transferred, please see the Firmware Upgrade Technical
   Note.

    1. The CT sends a Memory Configuration datagram command “Freeze” with an argument of Firmware Space.
       Note that a Datagram Received OK reply message is not always returned to this request.

    2. The CT waits for a Node Initialization Complete message from the Target Node.

    3. The CT sends a Protocol Support Inquiry to the Target Node to check whether it supports Stream
       protocol.

    4. The CT performs the Data Transfer.

    5. The CT resets the Target Node using a Memory Configuration datagram command “Unfreeze” with an
       argument of Firmware Space.
