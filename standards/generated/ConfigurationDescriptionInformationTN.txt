                                                     Configuration Description Information

                                                   Feb 15, 2015                        Preliminary          

                                                1 Introduction

   “"Configuration description information"” in this context refers to fixed information available from an
   OpenLCB device, via OpenLCB, so that other devices can properly and correctly configure it. The
   information is fixed, so that it can be pre-compressed, stored in the device, and just supplied when
   needed with minimal work on the part of the device and the device's developers. This means that e.g. the
   actual current configuration contents are not available as part of the CDI, as that is variable
   information. Similarly, the CDI cannot contain e.g. a serial number as that would require different CDI
   contents in each node of a single type.

   Other information may be available via e.g. manuals or the Internet, and there may be pointers to that
   information in the CDI, but the format of that information is not under specification here.

   A key use for CDI is to enable a Configuration Tool (CT) to know how to configure the node. The
   configuration tool will use the CDI information to render some form of suitable Graphical User Interface
   to allow the user to easily and intuitively configure all aspects of the node's capabilities. An
   important design choice was to embed the CDI into each node so that the system has all it needs to
   configure the node without having to source the information externally to the OpenLCB network from the
   manufacturer or some other on-line repository via the Internet or a CD/DVD etc. While the CT is likely
   to be a program running on a PC, it could be a hand-held device like mobile phone or PDA or even a
   custom-built device.

                                        2 Annotations to the Standard

2.1 Introduction

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

2.2 Intended Use

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

2.3 Reference and Context

   Note that this section of the Standard is informative, not normative.

   The Memory Configuration Protocol is one use for the CDI, and one way to retrieve it, but CDI is
   independent of that. See the OpenLCB Memory Configuration Protocol documentation.

   CiA 306 “Electronic data sheet specification” describes the CANopen version of a similar capability.

2.4 Content

   “Initialized State” means talking on the OpenLCB, so CDI is fixed while you're up. But it can change
   when the node e.g. resets.

   The CDI information isn't allowed to change while the node is up. A node may not change it after any
   part of it has been retrieved and before the next transition of the node away from the Initialized
   state. (The transition back to Initialized state tells other nodes to flush their caches and pick up any
   changed content.) A node using the CDI can assume that, once it's read the CDI, it doesn't need to read
   it again until the source node goes offline.

2.5 Format

   The format can be extended later for e.g. compression, via changes to the 1^st character or some other
   method.

   The choice of XML version 1.0 was made to restrict the XML feature set that can be utilized in the CDI
   documents. Because the using node may not have external connections, XML features requiring those
   (Xinclude, schema default values, …) are not be assumed to be present. By specifying XML 1.0 only,
   XInclude, XML Namespaces, XML Base, xml:id and other extensions have been excluded.

   The CDI may specify stylesheets (because the XML 1.0 standard is consistent with that).

   The online schema is really the normative thing, because that's what we check for conformance testing.

   There is no requirement that a node using the CDI to perform validate ion against the schema. But since
   the contents of the schema are normative, it has to obey the defaults, etc, for missing elements. There
   is further information about schema versions in the Section Future Extension.

   Because the using node may not have external connections, XML features requiring those (Xinclude, schema
   default values, …) are not be assumed to be present. By specifying XML 1.0 only, XInclude, XML
   Namespaces, XML Base, xml:id and other extensions have been excluded.

   The CDI may specify stylesheets (because the XML 1.0 standard is consistent with that)

   Hexadecimal notation (0x1234) for numbers is not permitted. Although it may have made the CDI easier for
   people to read, the XML is primarily intended for consumption by OpenLCB nodes. Providing optional
   coding, such as hexadecimal numbers, makes those nodes more complex.

  2.5.1

  2.5.2 XML Elements

    2.5.2.1 <identification> Element

   There is a basic set of identifiers that allow a user to recognize a Node. These are: the manufacturer
   name, model name, certain version numbers; as well as a user-definable name and description. The first
   set of these is called “fixed” node identification information, because it only depends on the hardware
   (and firmware) of the node. The second set is user-modifiable, or “variable” identification of the node.

   There are three ways to a Configuration Tool or a Network Browser tool to access this basic
   indentification information:

     * The fixed information may be encoded in the CDI as specific XML tags.

     * Both the fixed and the variable information can be available as specific Memory Spaces in a fixed
       format. This is called ACDI (or Abbreviated Configuration Description Information). This access
       method allows changing the variable information.

     * Both the fixed and the variable information can be fetched with one single message specifically
       designed for light-weight enumeration of all nodes using the Simple Node Information Protocol.

   This Standard specifies the CDI-held information and for format and access to the ACDI-held information.
   The standard also requires that all these different access methods must return the same values.

    2.5.2.2 <acdi> Element

   ACDI defines two specific memory spaces that contain the basic identification information. The layout of
   these spaces is fixed in the standard, and allows the Configuration Tool to access these values without
   needing to fetch and parse the CDI.

   This is the equivalent descriptor to the ACDI spaces:

   <segment origin='0' space='252'>

   <group>

   <name>Manufacturer Information</name>

   <description>Manufacturer-provided fixed node description</description>

   <int size='1'>

   <name>Version</name>

   </int>

   <string size='41'>

   <name>Manufacturer Name</name>

   </string>

   <string size='41'>

   <name>Node Type</name>

   </string>

   <string size='21'>

   <name>Hardware Version</name>

   </string>

   <string size='21'>

   <name>Software Version</name>

   </string>

   </group>

   </segment>

   <segment origin='0' space='251'>

   <group>

   <name>User Identification</name>

   <description>Lets the user add his own description</description>

   <int size='1'>

   <name>Version</name>

   </int>

   <string size='63'>

   <name>Node Name</name>

   </string>

   <string size='64'>

   <name>Node Description</name>

   </string>

   </group>

   </segment>

   Manufacturers are encouraged to put these segments definitions into their CDI as well, especially the
   user-editable portion.

    2.5.2.3 <segment> Element

   A <segment> element is used to define information that is stored in a Memory Space (see the OpenLCB
   Memory Configuration Protocol). Some nodes may have only one memory space, others may have multiple.
   There can be multiple segments that bind to the same Memory Space.

   Node developers are advised to assign relatively short <name> values to segments, because certain
   Configuration Tools may use these as labels for a tabbed dialog box.

    2.5.2.4 Data Elements

   This is the point of the whole standard: the actual Variables. The most important information for each
   variable is how to access is.

   The Memory Configuration Protocol requires two values to access a piece of information: the Space number
   (8-bit integer) and the Address (32-bit integer). The Space value comes from the <segment> element.

   Addresses are laid out by data length using a depth-first traversal algorithm:

    1. At the start of the segment, set current_address to be the value of the attribute `origin' of the
       <segment> element, or 0 (zero) if this attribute is not present.

    2. For each child element:

        * increment current_address by the attribute `offset' if present (can be negative!)

        * if it is a primitive type

             * render the UI according to the element type, take current_address for data

             * post-increment current_address by the element size (8 for events, otherwise given by the
               `size' attribute)

        * if it is a group, check the replication count

             * render a box or separator and header except if group is empty

             * recurse into the group to lay out all child elements

             * if there is any remaining replication left, repeat from to rendering box or separator

   Data Elements support constraints for the values:

     * Integers have <min> and <max> elements inside. They constrain the range with endpoints inclusive,
       i.e. <min>5</min> allows value 5 but disallows value 4.

     * All elements support a <map> which can be used to constrain the possible values to a fixed list, as
       well as provide user-readable descriptions to the values. Inside the map, the <property> entry is
       the one that should be written to the node, and the <value> entry is the one that should be
       displayed to the user.
       A possible User Interface for displaying this

   Be aware that all data is to be written in big-endian byte order.

2.6 Future Expansion

   This section provides guarantees that allow for a Configuration Tool designed for the current version of
   the standard be able to configure a node designed for a future version of the standard, allowing at
   least a common set of functionality to operate properly.

   The guarantees given in the standard allow the algorithm for tracking the current_address to function
   properly for future minor versions of the standard. This ensures that all known Data Elements are laid
   out by the Configuration Tool as intended by the CDI developer. Any unknown Data Elements can be skipped
   by the Configuration Tool. It is advised for Configuration Tool developers to identify to the user that
   an unknown element was found and an update to the software of the Configuration Tool may be required to
   have proper access to it.

   On the other hand, a new major version of the standard may define the XML elements or the layout
   algorithm in a completely different way that prevents a Configuration Tool designed for an earlier
   version of the standard for properly following the layout algorithm.

                                      3 AdditionalBackground Information

3.1 Environment of Proposal

  3.1.1 Requirements

     * Each node needs to carry enough context that a stand-alone configuration tool can provide a useful
       human interface without getting any data from an external source, e.g. needing an Internet download
       to handle a new node type. This allows a quality configuration experience to happen in a completely
       self-contained system.

     * Users want to configure a node entirely over the OpenLCB, without physical interactions, e.g.
       pushing buttons.

  3.1.2 Preferences

     * Small nodes shouldn't need a lot of processing power, e.g. to compress or decompress data in real
       time. Memory usage should also be limited, but is a second priority.

     * Configuration retrieval operations should be state-less and idempotent to simplify software at both
       ends. This is a preference for the CDI retrieval mechanism, not the CDI itself.

     * Multiple independent configuration operations can proceed at the same time. Specifically, multiple
       devices should be able to retrieve correct configuration description information at the same time.
       This is a preference for the CDI retrieval mechanism, not the CDI itself.

  Design Points

   The “Variables” described here are not exactly the same thing as “Configuration Variables” (CVs) or
   “Node Variables” (NVs) that are discussed elsewhere, e.g. in DCC documentation. Those are aimed at
   storage, and so are grouped by address. The “Variables” here are grouped by function. “Long address”
   might be several DCC CVs, but would be one variable to this proposal. Similarly, DCC CV29 has lots of
   variables within it, each stored as bits.

   2) The primary design constraints are complexity and size in the OpenLCB device providing CDI, and
   complexity and size in the device consuming the CDI.

   2A) Size and complexity in the providing device is the more important constraint. There are more of
   those devices, they are cost sensitive, and they may not be upgradableupgradeable once delivered.

   2B) Size and complexity in the CDI-consuming device should also be considered. In particular, code
   complexity is an issue which must be addressed.

   3) Secondary constraints are testability of the provided information, scalability of the format, and the
   convenience and availability of a suitable toolchain.

   4) There is a physical/logical structure to the configuration which the CDI can and should reflect:

   4A) The basic OpenLCB unit is a "Node". Nodes provide CDI for their needed configuration information.
   The protocol for that will be defined elsewhere/elsewhen.

   4B) A Node can contain zero or more "Producers". Each Producer is independently configured. There is no
   ordering between separate Producers, but they can be numbered for ease of reference.

   4C) A Node can contain zero or more "Consumers". Each Consumer is independently configured. There is no
   ordering between separate Consumers, or between individual Consumers and Producers, but they can be
   numbered for ease of reference.

   4D) Each Producer or Consumer can be configured with zero or one Events. A hardware port may have
   morethan one Producer or Consumer (for example two: off and on).

   4E) Each Event has an Identifier which uniquely defines it. An event may optionally carry additional
   data.

   4F) To ensure future growth, there is no required "device", "channel" or other grouping within a node.
   Those may be present in some node types, and CDI must be able to represent them, but may not require any
   specific organization. In other words, organizing the configuration is left up to the Node developers.
   One OpenLCB product may be considered superior to another of equivalent hardware capabilities purely
   because its configuration is easier to understand and use for the end-user.

  3.1.3 Storage

   The configuration definition is stored in a hierarchical manner.

   I) In what follows:

   A "String" must be present; an "Optional String" does not have to be. Strings are in UTF-8.

   An "Integer" may be signed; if no sign, it's taken as positive.

   A "Map" provides a set of named descriptive values. It contains:

   Name: Optional String, if present required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Description: Optional String

   1 or more "Key", "Value" pairs. Each element of the pair can be of any supported type, depending only on
   how it is to be used.

   Map elements provide a mapping between the pairs they contain. For example, a map can relate numeric
   values for a variable to descriptionve strings. A map can also be used to provide free-form
   documentation when neither the key nor the value are specified in advance. It may be useful in the
   future to specify how maps can be defined at the group level to reduce duplication. Having the
   possibility of a “Name” is meant to ease that future effort.

   II) At the top, root level is the information for a "node". This includes:

   Manufacturer: String

   Descriptive Map: May contain “Model”, “Version”, “URL” and “Description” keys, along with any others
   desired.

   Model: If present, the human-readable model name the manufacturer gives to this node.

   Version: If present, the human-readable version string for the current board.

   An optional Map for storing custom attributes defined by the manufacturer.Description: Optional String

   URL: If present, a URL for more information. No specific content is expected at the URL; If desired,
   that can be dealt with in a different specification.

   Any other information desired can be added via additional keysto this map.

   III) Within the node is zero or more "groups". Each group contains:

   Name: String, required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Descriptive Mapon: Map of documentation information; the “Description” key is the basic item.Documents
   to the end-user the logical contents.

   Replication count: Integer >= 1 (number of times this group is replicated within the parent item)

   A group with a replication count > 1 (called a replicated group) can be used to represent a type of
   replicated device. For example, a node with 4 identical input devices and 6 identical output devices can
   be compactly described by two groups, with replication counts of 4 and 6 respectively.

   Individual groupsInstances within replicated groups are numbered from 1 to the replication count. If
   more than one replicated group is present, the numbering for each starts again with 1.

   Groups may contain one or more inner groups, with the same representation. This may continue to any
   desired level.

   IV) Groups may contain "variable", "producer" and/or "consumer" descriptions. of various types.

   IV-a) A "variable" description contains:

   Type: represented by the element tag. Can be int, string (UTF-8), eventid. Previously other types were
   also considered, e.g. "bit", "digit" (an unsigned binary-coded-decimal value), "signed" (a binary value
   with a sign), "unsigned" (a binary value without a sign), "blob" (arbitrary byte vector).

   Name: String, required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Type: Exactly one of "boolean", "digit" (an unsigned binary-coded-decimal value), "signed" (a binary
   value with a sign), "unsigned" (a binary value without a sign), "string" (a UTF-8 string, not-null
   terminated), or "blob" (arbitrary byte vector).

   Max: Integer - For string and blob variables, the maximum number of bytes that can be stored. For digit,
   signed and unsigned types, the maximum value allowed.

   Min: Integer - For digit, signed and unsigned values, the minimum value allowed.

   Size: describes how many bytes are occupied by this variable. Also used for integers, to describe the
   data type size (e.g. byte, word, dword etc).

   Description: Optional String

   Default: requiredvalue of this Type, optional, for integer type only

   Offset: Optional integer offset with in the configuration address space for this item; if not present,
   to skip before this element in the layout, data is otherwise laid out by length in depth-first order.

   A variable may contain zero or one map descriptions. If present, the map represents a mapping between
   possible values (the "KeyProperty" part of the map's pairs) and convenient names for them (the "Value"
   part of the map's pairs).

   Note that the current value of a variable is not considered configuration definition information (see
   item 1A and 1B in the introduction).

   Configuration information must not be packed into variables; each variable must represent one type of
   information. In particular, the use of individual bits within larger values to pack multiple pieces of
   information is forbidden; those must be represented as individual variables. (How the information is
   stored internally is up to the designer of the specific device, and is not restricted; this requirement
   is about access to the information, not about how it's laid out in physical memory. A possible way to
   organize internally bit-mapped information is to use an address translation scheme which maps each bit
   to a byte.)

   IV-b) A "producer" description contains:

   Name: String, required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Description: Optional String

   Replication count: Integer >= 1 (number of times this producer definition is replicated within the
   parent item)

   Offset: Optional integer offset with in the configuration address space for this item; if not present,
   data is laid out by length in depth-first order.

   A producer description may contain zero or more variable descriptions for any variables that configure
   details of the producer's function.

   IV-c) A "consumer" description contains:

   Name: String, required to be unique within enclosing group or node

   Description: Optional String

   Replication count: Integer >= 1 (number of times this consumer definition is replicated within the
   parent item)

   Offset: Optional integer offset with in the configuration address space for this item; if not present,
   data is laid out by length in depth-first order.

   A consumer description may contain zero or more variable descriptions for any variables that configure
   details of the consumer function. This may include e.g. variables that define how any content in
   incoming messages will be used.

3.2 Example

   The following is not meant to show how configuration definition information would be stored, but what
   kinds of information would be stored. It's a description of a complex accessory decoder, the Digitrax
   DS54, modified for use in a Producer-Consumer model.

   Hopefully the syntax will be self-explanatory. In any case, it's just for this example, not a proposal
   of any kind.

   ConsumerVariable end:

   Group end: (This is end of the "Channel" group)

   Group end: (This is end of the "Decoder" group)

   Some thoughts based on putting this example together:

   1) In a real DS54, there are subtle differences between the Switch and Aux configuration choices on the
   various channels. I blurred those here by documenting them identically via replication. For a real
   device, they could either be separately specified or (more likely) the differences wouldn't matter in a
   P/C-based device.

   2) A DS54 can receive messages that put its output into four states: One side on, the other side on,
   both sides on, and neither side on. These four interacts with the "Output Type" setting in weird and
   wonderful ways. This was represented as four consumers. This seems a much more logical way to configure
   the device, as it gives more flexibility to the rest of the layout that's originating the requests.

   3) The DS54 inputs also generate messages. They are specified as two producers (for the active and
   inactive messages).

3.3 Implementation and Expansion NotesNotes about compression

   This section is non-normative notes and suggestions for implementors.

   Some references for XML compression:

   http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-datacompression/index.html?cmp=dw&cpb=dwxml&ct=dwnew&cr=dwnen&ccy=zz&csr=072111

   http://www.cs.panam.edu/~artem/main/teaching/csci6370spring2011/papers/XML%20compression%20techniques%20A%20survey%20and%20comparison.pdf

   On the other hand, a look-back compression algorithm has the advantage that it's cheap to decompress and
   might do almost as well:

   http://excamera.com/sphinx/article-compression.html

   XML strings can start with a UTF BOM (either 0xEF, 0xFF or 0xFE in the 1^st byte, since there's no need
   to support UTF-32BE or UTF-32LE), or the UTF-8 text for “<?xml” which starts with 0x3C. (But concern
   about support for too many character sets!)

   A first byte of 0x80 is defined as the “Compressed” indicator(s), followed by a byte that indicates the
   compression type. (We don't want to have too many kinds, as receivers need to implement all of them to
   be able to use the CDI!) 0x80 00 is the code for our choice of default, see
   http://excamera.com/sphinx/article-compression.htmlRemaining items
