                               4 Stuff to be merged into the above (or the TN)

   The first byte is used to distinguish the coding.

   “<” (which is part of the XML “<?xml version='1.0'?>” definition): Uncoded characters

   UTF BOM: Various UniCode forms

   0x01 – tag for compressed. One format defined for total start string of 0x0101. (If you want to use
   another format, decompress on board)

   (can't use 0x00 as lead, since that's the end-of-string indication)
