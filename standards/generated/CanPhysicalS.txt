   This document describes the physical layer for carrying NMRAnet over a Controller Area Network (CAN)
   link or links and . It describes nothing else. Seriously, if you want to know about Ethernet, or modular
   standards for power connections, or how to make really good fried chicken, look elsewhere.  Lorem ipsum

                                   Section TitleIntended Use (Informative)

   Suitable NMRAnet nodes can be connected by cables to form a linear CAN bus with optional short stubs.
   Users can expect to be able to form networks within limitations:

     * Total cable length of 1000 ft / 300m; stub cables count double their length in that total; nodes
       count as 20 ft / 6m in that total

     * Never less than 1 ft / 30cm of cable between nodes, nor between a stub connection and a node.

     * No more than 50 nodes connected

   NMRAnet nodes generally have two RJ45 modular connectors and can be daisy-chained together with suitable
   computer-network (“Ethernet”) cables. A CAN terminator is installed by the user at each end of the main
   bus.

   A limited amount of power can be distributed via the cable, allowing a few nodes to draw limited power
   from a short (10 ft / 3m) length of the common bus.

   CAN connections between nodes shall be made using UTP cable. connectors are provided, tf i tub ,I. where
   the cable is permanently connected to the node, which is common for throttlesonnectors are not
   requiredCThere shall be a RJ45 plug on the cable and RJ45 jack on the node. unless the cable is
   permanently attached to the node.

   The signal, conductor and pair assignments shall be:

   Cables, including cables attached to nodes, shall carry conductors 1 & 2 as a pair, and conductors 3 & 6
   as a pair.

   Cables may, but are not required to, carry conductors 4 and 5. Conductors 4 and 5, if present, shall be
   carried as a pair.

   Cables may, but are not required to, carry conductors 7 and 8. Conductors 7 and 8, if present, shall be
   carried as a pair.

   If a node provides two or more connections are provided, cconductors 1 through 8 shall be provided on
   all connections. Conductors 1 through 7 shall be connected in parallel on all connectorsconnections with
   connections rated for current of at least 1A.. If the node does not provide power on pin 8 on all
   connectors, pin 8 on all connectors must be connected in parallel. All with connections rated for
   current of at least 1A. wiring discussed in this paragraph shall be rated to carry at least 1A.

   Nodes shall connect conductors 3 and 6 with a connection . This connection must be rated for a current
   of at least 1A.

   A node may, but is not required to, connect conductor 7 with conductors 3 and 6.

   Voltages of up to 100 volts AC or either polarity DC on the reserved conductors shall not damage the
   node nor prevent normal operation of the node.

   Voltages of up to 25 volts AC or either polarity DC on the PWR_NEG / PWR_POS conductors shall not
   permanently damage the node.

                                          Data Transport (Normative)

   Data shall be transferred using a CAN signal at 125kbps and CAN frame protocol. The bit slew rate of the
   CAN signal, as transmitted, shall be less than 10V/microsecond and more than 4V/microsecond.

                                         Supply of Power (Normative)

   A node may, but is not required to, provide power to the cable PWR_POS / PWR_NEG conductors.

   If a node provides power, it shall provide at least 9VDC and no more than 15VDC from zero current draw
   up to its specified maximum current. Its specified maximum current shall not exceed 1A. The specified
   maximum current shall be permanently written on the node in a location visible to the user. This label
   is required whether or not the node provides power to the cable. (needs a “shall withstand” clause for
   applied external voltage?)(needs a “shall withstand short circuits on the output ...”?)

                                       Consumption of Power (Normative)

   Nodes may, but are not required to, draw power from the PWR_POS / PWR_NEG conductors in the cable. Nodes
   shall not draw more than 250mA at any PWR_POS / PWR_NEG voltage from 7.5VDC to 15VDC. Nodes that draw
   power shall operate properly with a supply voltage of 7.5VDC to 15VDC on the PWR_POS / PWR_NEG
   conductors. The maximum current drawn by each node shall be permanently written on that node in a
   location visible to the user. This label is required whether or not the node draws power from the cable.
