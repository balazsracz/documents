                                                           OpenLCB Unique Identifiers

                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This specification describes the format and allocation of OpenLCB 48-bit uUnique iIdentifiers. It is not
   specific to any wire protocol.

   For more information on format and presentation, see:

   OpenLCB Common Information Technical NoteMany OpenLCB protocols rely on each node having a Node ID, and
   those Node IDs being absolutely unique between nodes. OpenLCB defines 48-bit unique identifiers for this
   purpose. Unique Identifiers are also used to ensure that Event Identifiers are uniquely specified. This
   Standard is intended to ensure these Unique Identifiers are available. It applies to all OpenLCB uses of
   48-bit Unique Identifiers, including as Node Identifiers.

                              2 Intended UseReferences and Context (Informative)

   This specification is in the context of the following OpenLCB Standards:

     * The Message Network Standard, which defines the basic messages and how they interact. Higher-level
       protocols are based on this message network, but are defined elsewhere.

     * The Event Identification Standard, which defines the well-known Events Identifiers.

     * Many OpenLCB protocols rely on each node having a node ID, and those node IDs being absolutely
       unique between nodes. OpenLCB defines 48-bit unique identifiers for this purpose. Unique identifiers
       are also used to ensure that Event Identifiers are uniquely specified, and for other purposes. This
       Standard is intended to ensure these unique IDs are available. It applies to all OpenLCB uses of
       48-bit unique identifiers, including as node identifiers.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   (Intentionally left blank)

                                       4 Content and Format (Normative)

   An OpenLCB unique identifier (uUnique ID) shall be six bytes of eight bits each.

   The order of bytes in an OpenLCB unique IDdentifier shall be considered significant. The
   most-significant byte shall be transmitted first during communication operations. The most-significant
   byte shall be written first (left-most in Western format) in any human-readable representation. Within
   the tables below, byte 1 is considered the most-significant byte, while byte 6 is considered the least
   significant byte.

   An OpenLCB uUnique IDdentifier shall include one or more 1 bits.

   Every OpenLCB node shall have a uUnique iIdentifier to use as a nNode iIdentifier (nNode ID).

                                           5 Allocation (Normative)

   Unique identifiers shall be allocated using one of the mechanisms in this section.

   When additional allocation methods are defined, hose tthe uUnique IDdentifiers defined by those
   additional methods shall only provide allocation ranges that do no overlap with existing allocation
   ranges.

   Allocated ranges shall not be reused for other allocations.

   Ranges that are not explicitly allocated are reserved for future use unless otherwise noted within this
   document.

5.1 Overview

   Unique Identifiers are allocated in groups starting with the most significant byte as the macro group
   assignment.

5.5 Unique identifiers assigned by members of organized groupsSelf-Assigning Groups

   These Unique Identifiers are assigned in association with an outside organizations unique identification
   scheme. The outside organization is responsible for assigning a globally unique identifier that maps
   into the OpenLCB Unique Identifier space designated in the table below. Future definition of ranges for
   additional groups will use unique values in Byte 2.

                                                                  least significant byte is self-assigned.

   An NMRA member may, but is not required to, use their NMRA membership number to self-assign unique
   identifiers within the range defined by:

   Individuals using these assignment patterns shall ensure uniqueness for identifiers they assign.

   MERG CBUS has a defined method for specifying a unique 16-bit Node Number (NN) for CBUS use, along with
   an optional 16-bit Layout Number (LN). People may, but are not required to, use a unique CBUS node
   number to generate an OpenLCB unique identifier as follows:

    Byte 1        Byte 2        Byte 3              Byte 4             Byte 5             Byte 6

   Future definition of ranges for additional groups will use unique values in Byte 2.

5.6 Unique identifiers aAssigned by sSoftware at rRunt-time

   A program running in a computer with an IP address must not use that address to directly formulate a
   unique identifier. The program may use an IP connection to request a unique identifier from openlcb.org,
   or from another organization that is distributing unique identifiers from a range distributeddesignated
   to it. The openlcb.org mechanism will allocate individual unique identifiers from the following range:

    Byte 1  Byte 2  Byte 3   Byte 4    Byte 5    Byte 6   Organization               Comment

5.7 Specifically Assigned by Request

   These ranges are assigned by the OpenLCB organization. Periodically, but not on a predetermined
   schedule, this document will be updated with any additionally assigned ranges. The OpenLCB organization
   reserves the right to allocate additional Unique Identifiers out of this pool without updating this
   document, and a comprehensive list of specifically assigned Unique Identifiers is maintained in
   real-time on the OpenLCB Organization web site. In the unlikely event that the OpenLCB organization
   website is in conflict with the latest officially adopted version of this document, the document
   represents the true allocation.

5.8 Unique identifiers assigned for use with locomotive control systemsLocomotive Control Systems

   OpenLCB defines specific well-known identification numbers and number ranges for interoperation with
   existing locomotive control systems. The details of these ranges are defined in other Standards and/or
   have been reserved for future use.This Unique identifier range (starting with a most significant byte
   value of 0x06) was originally allocated for locomotive control systems. These allocations are no longer
   valid, because locomotive control is being implemented differently than originally conceived. For
   historical reasons, the values are displayed here. Do not use these Unique Identifiers for any reason,
   as their use has been deprecated, and they may be re-designated for another purpose in the future.

5.11 RFID and NFC

   The RFID Unique Identifiers space is reserved for further specification in the future. Do not use this
   space before contacting the OpenLCB organization first.

5.12 Temporary Assigned by Software at Runtime

   A program running in a computer with an IP address must not use that address to directly formulate a
   unique identifier. Furthermore, a program may dynamically allocate nodes who need a Unique Identifier
   assigned to them. The program may use an IP connection, or another unspecified method, to request a
   unique identifier from openlcb.org, or from another organization that is distributing unique identifiers
   from a range designated to it.

   These Unique Identifiers are assigned on a leased basis. A temporary (leased) Unique Identifier server
   will issue a Unique Identifier that is valid for a designated period of time. When the lease period is
   up, the Unique Identifier server may re-issue the same Unique Identifier to another node as needed. The
   Unique Identifier server and client can periodically negotiate an extension of the lease indefinitely.
